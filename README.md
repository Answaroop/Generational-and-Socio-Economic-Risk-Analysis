# Generational and Socio-Economic Risk Analysis

## Project Overview
This project explores the interplay between generational and socio-economic factors in financial risk preferences and investment behavior. By analyzing the risk-taking tendencies of different generations (Baby Boomers, Millennials, Gen Z) and socio-economic classes (Rich, Poor), the project offers valuable insights into how wealth and generational backgrounds influence investment strategies.

## Key Highlights
- **Data Simulation and Analysis**: 
  - Simulated realistic dummy data for three generations and two socio-economic classes.
  - Key features: risk-taking scores, initial income, and investment preferences.
  
- **Statistical Insights**:
  - Analyzed risk-taking tendencies, revealing that 80% of the rich and 55% of the poor are calculated risk-takers.
  - Performed T-tests and chi-square tests to understand dependencies and variations in financial behavior.
  
- **Predictive Modeling**:
  - Developed regression models to identify key factors influencing risk-taking behavior.
  - Simulated wealth growth and risk-adjusted returns based on different investment preferences.
  
- **Comparative Financial Benchmarking**:
  - Integrated simulated benchmarks like the S&P 500 to compare returns across different groups.
  - Highlighted return differences and correlated them with risk-taking scores.
  
- **Data Visualization**:
  - Created comprehensive visualizations to display risk-taking distributions, wealth growth projections, and return analyses.

## Key Results
- Gained insights into the relationship between generational and class-based investment behavior.
- Revealed wealth growth potential and return optimization strategies tailored to different socio-economic groups.
